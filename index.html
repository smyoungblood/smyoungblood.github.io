	<h1>Hello.<br>I'm Shay.</h1>
	<h2>Junior Developer</h2>
		
	<p>Everyone starts somewhere. So here I am, excited about learning new skills & pursuing a career path in web development. Stay tuned as I intend to share my future portfolio on this very site, the first one I have built.</p>

	<h3>How Did I Get Here?</h3>

	<p>My career path goes something like this: Event Planner, Staffing Recruiter, Email Marketing Coordinator, Investment Firm Sales Rep. After working in a variety of industries, I can say what drives me most is the opportunity to continuously grow and to be challenged. So this seems like a natural next step.</p>

	<h3>Why Hire Me?</h3>

	<p>Do you want someone who is willing to take on new projects & gets excited for a challenge? Hire me. Do you want someone who is detail-oriented, organized, can work just as well with a team as alone? Hire me. If you somehow landed on my site, thank you for taking a look around. I am more than eager to chat if you have any questions.</p>



	<p>And just for fun, here is a drone video of Ireland, somewhere I hope to visit soon.</p>
